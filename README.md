# RP2040_SHT31
This program reads temperature and humidity data from the SHT31D sensor via I2C and displays them on a seven-segment LED display using a low-precision repeated mode. It also includes two threads, one of which is inactive and is used to balance thread usage. The program executes the threads using the ThreadController library's run function.
